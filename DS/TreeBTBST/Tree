Tree is recursive data structure
In a valid tree for N Nodes there are N-1 Edges
Depth of node x = length of path from root to x OR No. of edges in path from root to x
Height of Node X = No. of edges in longest path from x to a leaf
Height of tree = Height of root node



Binary Tree (BT): A tree in which each node can have at most 2 children
Implementing BT is usually in Double linked list

Applications of trees:
file system
organize data: quick search, insertion, deletion (Binary search tree)
Trie -> dictionary
Network Routing Algorithm
