BinarySearchTree(BST):

Array: Search(x), Insert(x), Remove(x)  best case and worst case
Array sorted: O(lognbase2), O(n), O(n)

BST: O(lognbase2), O(lognbase2), O(lognbase2)

BST: A binary tree in which for each node, value of all the nodes in left subtree is lesser or equal and 
value of all the nodes in right subtree is greater.
