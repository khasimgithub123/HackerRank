Binary Tree (BT):

BT: each node can have at most 2 children
root
left child
right child
leaf - node with zero nodes

Depth or Level
Max no of nodes at level i = 2^i
Max no of nodes in a tree with height h 
   = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + .... + 2^h
   = 2^h+1 -1
   = 2^(no.of levels) - 1
   
 Height of perfect binary tree with n nodes = log(n+1)base2-1
 Height of complete binary tree with n nodes = floor(lognbase2)
 
 Implement BT using linked list and Arrays
